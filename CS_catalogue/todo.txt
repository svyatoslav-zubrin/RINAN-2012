To do list:
1. catalogue of the II class MM for CS observations:
	Columns of the catalogue
		- name (from original source catalogue: pestlozzi, xu, valtts, new chinese)
		- coordinates from the original MM maser (in the epoch of the source catalogue)
		- epoch of the coordinates
		- Vlsr of the maser from the catalogue
		- flux dencity of the maser
		
		- our CS observation results with parameters 
		- quality of the obtained CS spectrum
		- mark for observations (needed or not)

		- associated masers from other catalogues
		- associated IRAS source
		- associated CS (1-0) observations results with parameters (see bronfman, larionov, beuther, Szymczak(07) observations)
		- distance from the third-party observational point and maser source (if possible)

Tasks for catalog creation:
- create list of masers (unique): compare coordinates of masers from different catalogues. Limit: 15arcsec
- create list of our observations of the CS molecule
- create lists of third-party observations of the CS molecule
compare:


Tasks for programming:
- class LarionovSource:Source
- reqork all "descriptions" methods
